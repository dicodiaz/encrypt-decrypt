      Welcome to Encrypt - Decrypt! In this site, you will find an encryption game and a decryption
      feature. The goal of the game is simple: Try to decrypt the sentence! Every sentence will be
      in english. Tip: Each encrypted letter is the same for the whole sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also test the machine with your own sentences. Try encrypting any sentence by yourself
      and input it into the decryption feature and it will return your original sentence! You could
      also use this feature as a last resource to decrypt sentences from the encryption game.
