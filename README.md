# Encrypt-Decrypt

This website contains two main sections: Encrypt and Decrypt. The Encrypt section features a fun game that allows the player to guess an encrypted word, letter by letter. The Decrypt section features a decrypting algorithm that allows the user to decrypt any sentence previously encrypted with the [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). Built with React, Redux, and Bootstrap.
